                    Samplify was the biggest shit show ever. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1vsr5d/developed_this_app_called_samplify_that_listens/"> We posted to reddit and received overwhelming support from the r/Music community. </a> Within 24 hours we were developers of a top 25 music app in the Play Store and in talks with Universal Music Group. Within 48 hours we were in a hacking war with WhoSampled.

                    The team fought back for an entire week. WhoSampled is based in Wales, so as they went to bed we would push fixes to the app, and every time we woke up we needed to find new ways to access their data. Eventually we ripped apart their site so badly that they had to hash their URLs and send us a final cease and desist.

                    Meddling was fun, but we werenâ€™t looking to cause serious trouble. After we received the C&D, we decided to retire the app. Our final goodbye is available <a href="http://samplifymobile.com/">on our homepage</a>.
